== Overview

The Pi Camera is a minimal digital camera build which automatically uploads your photographs.
When a picture is taken and saved to the `~/Pictures` directory, its presence is automatically detected by {systemd}.
When an internet connection is next available, systemd uploads the photos to either S3-compatible object storage with {Rclone} or to {Immich} with the {Immich-CLI}.
The photos are then removed from local storage.
This is all accomplished with help of my {AutoUpload} project.
This repository documents how I've made the camera, the configuration files I've used, and the procedure to create the camera.

== Components

The Pi Camera is based off of the Raspberry Pi 4 and the Camera Module 3.
The camera uses Pimoroni's HyperPixel 4.0 screen which has good support in the Raspberry Pi kernel and full graphics acceleration.
The screen also works under Wayland.
A momentary push button is used to take pictures.
The HyperPixel 4.0 screen takes up all of the pins, only exposing an I2C bus.
The PCF8574 I2C GPIO Expander is used to connect the momentary push button and GPS to the Raspberry Pi.
An I2C GPS is used to incorporate {Exif} geolocation metadata in the pictures.

[NOTE]
====
Although the Raspberry Pi 5 is now out, it requires active cooling and a higher power input.
This makes it less suitable for a portable camera than the Raspberry Pi 4.

I'd recommend getting a battery with at least a 5000mAh capacity with the smallest form factor possible.
I use the https://www.adafruit.com/product/4288[USB Li-Ion Power Bank with 2 x 5V Outputs @ 2.1A - 5000mAh].
* A USB-C cable for powering the Pi.
* A case.
I found that LEGO Technics make a pretty sturdy case.
A minimal $13 LEGO Technics set was sufficient for making the enclosure for the camera.
I bought a second to make the case even better and add an enclosure for the battery.
I've been avoiding dealing with CAD files, but it should be possible to make some modifications to the CAD files from Jeff Geerling's https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-camera[Raspberry Pi Camera] to account for the HyperPixel 4.0 screen.

== Build

The build is pretty straightforward.
It requires solder and a soldering iron to wire the PCF8574 to the momentary push button.

. Trim the length of the wires on the momentary push button.
They can be trimmed pretty short, but keep enough room to make up for any mistakes.
I only kept a couple of centimeters on each wire.
. Solder the leads of the momentary push button to the PCF8574 I2C GPIO Expander breakout.
Solder the black lead to ground and the red lead to `P0`.
. Attach the HyperPixel 4.0 to the Raspberry Pi.
Follow the instructions from {Getting-Started-with-HyperPixel-4-0}.
. Plug the male header pins on the STEMMA QT / Qwiic JST SH 4-pin to Premium Male Headers Cable to the HyperPixel 4.0.
With the screen face up, and the pins and micro HDMI ports facing towards you, the pins are ordered ground, clock, data, and power from left to right.
The associated cable colors are documented in the following table.

.Stemma Qt / Qwiic Cable Colors
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Function | Color

| Ground | Black
| Clock | Yellow
| Data | Blue
| Power | Red
|===

. Attach the JST SH plug on STEMMA QT / Qwiic cable with male headers to the PCF8574 breakout.
It can be connected to either end of the board.
. Attach one of the JST SH plugs on the other STEMMA QT / Qwiic cable to the Adafruit Mini GPS PA1010D breakout.
It can be connected to either end of the board.
. Connect the flex cable to the 2-lane MIPI CSI camera port on the Raspberry Pi.
This port is next to the audio jack on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.
The side with the silver lines should face towards the micro HDMI ports.
The blue side should face towards the USB ports.
This process is documented by Raspberry Pi in the https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#connecting-the-camera[Connecting the Camera] section of the Camera page.
+
[CAUTION]
====
Be gentle with the camera port, as they are fairly breakable.
====

. Connect the other end of the flex cable to the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3.
The silver lines should be facing up, towards the camera's lens.
. Install the camera module in the camera enclosure case.
. Fit the case.
I'm not going to detail my ad-hoc case build, though hopefully the pictures provide some guidance.
However, be aware that the camera module should be positioned upright.
This is confusing because upright actually looks sideways with how the text is printed on the camera module.
This is important because the picamera2 library only allows flipping the image 180° at this time.
Other software techniques are necessary to flip the camera image 90° or 270°.
Issues https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/issues/492[#492], https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/issues/774[#774], and https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/issues/792[#792] in the https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2[picamera2 Project] request this functionality.

== Install

. Install the 64-bit full version of https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/[Raspberry Pi OS] to a microSD card.
The configuration files assume the primary user is `pi-camera`, which can be configured when using Raspberry Pi Imager to write the image.
This project has been tested with Raspberry Pi OS 5 based on Debian Bookworm.
. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi.
. Boot the Raspberry Pi.
. Follow the instructions to configure the storage service and install the autoupload systemd units in the {AutoUpload} README to automatically upload photos in the `~/Pictures` directory.
The commands to enable the units should look similar to the following.
These use the _system_ units, though _user_ units work just as well.
+
Immich::
+
[,sh]
----
sudo systemctl enable --now autoupload-immich@$(systemd-escape --path ~/Pictures).path
----

Rclone::
+
[,sh]
----
sudo systemctl enable --now autoupload-rclone@$(systemd-escape --path ~/Pictures).path
----

. For security, be sure to disable password-based SSH authentication.
After your public key has been added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the Pi Camera, this can be configured in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.
You can follow the instructions in my https://github.com/jwillikers/openssh-config[OpenSSH Config] repository to accomplish this and a few other optimizations.

. Make the `~/Projects` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
mkdir --parents ~/Projects
----

. Clone this project's repository to the `~/Projects` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
git -C ~/Projects clone https://github.com/jwillikers/pi-camera.git
----

. Append the contents of the `boot/firmware/config.txt.append` file to the `/boot/firmware/config.txt` file.
+
[,sh]
----
cat ~/Projects/pi-camera/boot/firmware/config.txt.append | tee append /boot/firmware/config.txt
----

. Reboot.
. Update the package lists.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt-get update
----

. Upgrade everything.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt-get --yes full-upgrade
----

. Install the necessary and unnecessary packages.
I like fish, tmux, and vim, what can I say?
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt-get --yes install firewalld fish git python3-dev python3-picamera2 python3-venv raspberrypi-ui-mods tmux vim wlr-randr
----

. Change to the project's root directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd ~/Projects/pi-camera
----

. Create a symlink of the `wayfire.ini` file in the `~/.config` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
ln --relative --symbolic wayfire.ini ~/.config/wayfire.ini
----

. Create a virtual environment for the project.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
----

. Activate the virtual environment.
+
[,sh]
----
source venv/bin/activate.fish
----

. Install the dependencies in the venv.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m pip install --requirement requirements.txt
----

. Exit the virtual environment.
+
[,sh]
----
exit
----

. Create the systemd directory for user units.
+
[,sh]
----
mkdir --parents ~/.config/systemd/user
----

. Symlink the systemd unit to the `~/.config/systemd/user/` directory.
+
[,sh]
----
ln --force --relative --symbolic systemd/user/* ~/.config/systemd/user/
----

. Enable and start the `pi-camera.service` systemd unit.
+
[,sh]
----
systemctl --user enable --now pi-camera.service
----

=== Configure Screen Orientation

One of the things that may need tweaked is the screen orientation.
This is technically configured in two places, the `/boot/firmware/config.txt` file, where it can be changed using the `rotate` `dtparam`, and additionally in Wayfire.
The configuration for Wayfire is documented in the https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#setting-the-desktop-environment-resolution-and-rotation[Setting the desktop environment resolution and rotation section] of the Raspberry Pi Configuration documentation.
It is also described in the https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire-wiki/blob/master/Configuration.md[Configuration.md] file in the Wayfire repository.
The instructions here describe the basics necessary to rotate the screen.

. Determine the available display outputs with the `kmsprint` command.
Here, `DPI-1` corresponds to the HyperPixel 4.0.
+
[,sh]
----
kmsprint | grep Connector
Connector 0 (32) HDMI-A-1 (disconnected)
Connector 1 (42) HDMI-A-2 (disconnected)
Connector 2 (48) DPI-1 (connected)
----

. Use `wlr-randr` to rotate the display.
When running the command from an SSH connection, include the `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1` variable as done here.
+
[,sh]
----
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 wlr-randr --output DPI-1 --transform 90
----

. To make the change permanent, configure the rotation in the Wayfire configuration file.
+
.~/.config/wayfire.ini
[,ini]
----
[output:DPI-1]
transform = 90
----

== Development

It's recommended to use the provided {pre-commit} checks when developing.

. Create a virtual environment.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
----

. Activate the virtual environment.
+
[,sh]
----
source venv/bin/activate.fish
----

. Install the development packages.
+
[,sh]
----
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
----

. Install the packages.
This project uses pip-tools to synchronize virtual environments for development.
Sync your virtual environments packages with those pinned in the `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` files with the `pip-sync` command.
+
[,sh]
----
pip-sync requirements-dev.txt requirements.txt
----

. Install the Git hooks for pre-commit.
+
[,sh]
----
pre-commit install
----

. Run the tests with https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/[pytest].
+
[,sh]
----
pytest
----

. Upgrade the packages pinned in the `requirements.txt` file with the `pip-compile` command.
+
[,sh]
----
pip-compile \
  --allow-unsafe \
  --generate-hashes \
  --reuse-hashes \
  --upgrade \
  requirements.in
----

. The pinned development packages in the `requirements-dev.txt` file can be upgraded in the same fashion.
+
[,sh]
----
pip-compile \
  --allow-unsafe \
  --generate-hashes \
  --reuse-hashes \
  --upgrade \
  requirements-dev.in
----
